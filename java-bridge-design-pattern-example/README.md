# java-bridge-design-pattern
This is a basic Java project to demonstrate basically how to implement Bridge Design Pattern in Java.

My example is about a vehicle info application. The bridge class is [VehicleManager](/src/bridge/VehicleManager.java). 

This class is used as bridge for [Vehicle Implementation](/src/impl/VehicleImpl.java) class which is implementing the [Vehicle](/src/service/Vehicle.java) interface class.
