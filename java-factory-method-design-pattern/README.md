# java-singleton-design-pattern
This is a basic Java project to demonstrate basically how to implement Factory Method Design Pattern in Java.

My example is about a vehicle washing mini application. There is an abstract class called dto.Vehicle and concrete classes according to vehicle type that extends the dto.Vehicle class. There is factory class called factory.VehicleFactory.
